# Street-Racer---Console-Strategy-Game-
Developed a text-based racing simulation focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Implemented resource management (Stamina), AI opponent logic, and probability-based events (Turbo Boosts)
Street Racer – Console Strategy Game

A C# logic engine developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and game state management.

###  Gameplay Mechanics
- *Resource Management:* Players must balance *Speed* and *Stamina*. Accelerating increases distance but exhausts the racer.
- *AI Opponent:* A computerized rival ("Shadow Rider") that makes decisions each round.
- *Dynamic Probability:* A built-in "Turbo Boost" system with a 20% trigger rate for unpredictable finishes.

###  Technical Skills Demonstrated
- *Classes & Objects:* Created a modular Racer class to manage independent data for the player and AI.
- *Game Loop:* Implemented a turn-based loop with conditional win/loss logic.
- *Input Handling:* Real-time user decision-making via the console.
